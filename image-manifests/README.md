Image manifests files (eg. 1.0.0.json) live  here.

Note: Many may be ephemeral, i.e. injected and used in a build but not committed.

Note: The image manifest files in this directory in the `master` branch are 
manually added to enable testing of the tooling using this branch.
These files are not maintained by the snapshotting process and are not
used in any real snapshot.
