# Probably are different for each product:

ocp_versions_file="tools/downstream-image-manifest-gen/backplane-ocp-versions"
gen_bound_bundle_script="tools/bundle-manifests-gen/gen-bound-cmb-bundle.sh"

# Note: Currently, $manifest_gen_config_file is interpreted as being relative to
# the directory in which $mainfest_gen_script is found.  This probably wasn't a
# great choice, and perhaps it should be relative to CWD.  We'll carry this as
# a TODO to fix once we have all of our bundle bundling using the new approach
# of having config and render_templates be sourced from this repo.

manifest_gen_config_file="backplane-manifest-gen-config.json"

# Probablly are the same for all product bundle building:

common_render_templates_script="tools/downstream-image-manifest-gen/render-templates.sh"
manifest_gen_script="tools/downstream-image-manifest-gen/generate_manifest.py"
